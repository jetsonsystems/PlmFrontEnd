//
// Load anything which we absolutely need in the global namespace.
// For now, lets see if we can get away with NOT doing that.
// For example, we could add an equals sign to the following comment
// to global include jQuery:
//
// require ../lib/jquery/jquery.min
//
// Likewise, if we had some global.js in commone (which we don't) right now:
//
// require common/global
//
// So, at the moment assets/js/app/application.js should be an empty file.
